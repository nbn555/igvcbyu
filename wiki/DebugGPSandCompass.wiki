*Solutions*
(enter solutions here)
It never saw gga datums I had it working yesterday, I don't remember if I had to hack something or if the changes I made to the YclopsReactiveNav class did it. Eldon


*Compass Problems*
------------------

*Compass was returning degrees and MRPT wants radians. Eldon

*Solutions*
(enter solutions here)
*The compass had to have called doProcess first before any valid data will be retrieved.  I will change it so doProcess is called once in the constructor. Eldon
*The Compass was given a default parameter of true if the value was to be returned in degrees
