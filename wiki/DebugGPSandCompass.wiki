#Document to help track the debugging process with the GPS and Compass

= Introduction =

Please document your debugging steps and solutions to problems here. Also list the current problems that need to be fixed and which ones are completed.

----
== GPS: ==
  # `done` *Why does the GPS get bad data?* 
    * It never saw gga datums I had it working yesterday, I don't remember if I had to hack something or if the changes I made to the `YclopsReactiveNav` class did it. _--Eldon_
  # *(enter more problems here)* 
    * (enter solutions here)

-------------------

== Compass: ==

  # `done` *Why does the compass->getYaw() return 0?*
    * The compass had to have called doProcess first before any valid data will be retrieved.  I will change it so doProcess is called once in the constructor. _--Eldon_
  # *Compass was returning degrees and MRPT wants radians.*
    * The Compass was given a default parameter of true if the value was to be returned in degrees
  # `done` *MRPT is trying to do a lot of math to guess at the yaw trying to make up for not having a compass which Always output a 0.*
    * Bypass MRPT on the yaw on save it ourselves.
